This project was performed as a part of Udacity Nano-Degree in machine learning

In this project,  real-life data provided by Udacity partners. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 

In this Project, unsupervised learning techniques were utilized to organize the general population of Germany into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

Technlogies used : 
 * Python
 * Data wrangling
 * Feature Engineering
 * Feature Extraction (PCA)
 * Unsupervise Machine Learning (Kmeans)
